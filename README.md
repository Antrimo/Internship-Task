# Intern Task

A simple app with a number and 2 buttons. One button increments the number, the other decrements it. The first time opening the app, there should be an overlay with a guide explaining how the app works and prompting the user to click each of the buttons while highlighting the change it makes. All subsequent times using the app, it should not give the guide
